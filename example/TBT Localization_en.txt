"Could I get one Boba Milk Tea and one Boba Americano?"

"It does not meet the standard of cleanliness of the Ministry of Health."
"I have no choice but to issue you a fine of $100"
"Luckily your shop has met the bare minimum standard..."
"Please make sure to clean your shop thoroughly next time."

"And make it quick, some of us have real jobs to get back to!"
""
"For a second there, I thought I’d have to teach you how to brew coffee."

"Boba Matcha Milk Tea!"
"Hurry, I need to get back to my IMPORTANT work"

"Good job I guess!"

"Where the hell have you been?!"
"I’ve been ringing that bell for 10 minutes straight!"
"Not everyone has time to sit around and wait for you to finish whatever you were doing!"
"I could’ve walked to another cafe, grabbed a drink, and come back by now."
"Is this how you treat your customers? No wonder this place is always so quiet."
"You can’t just leave the counter unattended like that!"
"What if someone came in and robbed the place?"
